# Tegulas AutoTile

Automatic tile placement with minimal effort!

This tool makes it easy to create autotiles (tiles that change its sprite based on a set of rules) using native Unity Tilemap system.

It also creates a complete tileset with 47 combinations (covering every possible tile placement) from a simple, 5 tiles wide, texture.
